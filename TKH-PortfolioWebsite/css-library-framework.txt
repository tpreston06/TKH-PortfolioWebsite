Tailwind

The Tailwind framework has a utility-first approach to building custom user interfaces. This means Tailwind works by allowing users to easily apply pre-existing classes directly into your HTML files like an inline style sheet. It's very customizable, by providing the the user with more flexibility over what the application looks like vs other framesworks. It also allows you to build designs without having to compromise on your style globally within your application.

This framework allows you to create applications faster and easier. It has all the building blocks needed to create unique designs. Without the need to create a separate CSS file, you can control the layout, color, spacing, typography, shadows, and more with Tailwind.

Benefits of Tailwind Include:
Write less custom CSS
Smaller CSS files
No need to create class names
Make safer changes
