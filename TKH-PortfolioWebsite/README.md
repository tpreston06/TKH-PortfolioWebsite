(see syllabus: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mmPcVm5xqCGF78b0w09OmUhoPOf8SJU7RkYcfNOO_wo/edit#heading=h.a5vkk7mqo44j) 

- Use the linked Figma Design File Template that includes: mobile wireframe, desktop wireframe, style guide, and 3 references of portfolio layouts.

If your website layout comes out different than your wireframe, that is okay. 
- Create at least (1) HTML page that includes: Your name, an introductory paragraph (perhaps your Elevator Pitches from Career Class could be used here) defining your goals as an aspiring web developer, and a project section with 3 placeholder areas for your projects. Use semantic tags: nav, header, main, footer
- Create 1 CSS file -  for desktop size,  use flexbox to create the layouts.
- Research a CSS library/framework such as Bootstrap, Material UI, Tailwind, Bulma and write 2 paragraphs about how it works and cite at least 2 articles - include this as a text file in your repo
